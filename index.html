      <h3>Oil/Watercolor/Acrylic realist painter</h3>
      <p>Dane Hamblin was born in Phoenix, Arizona in the United States and graduated with a degree in Fine Arts specializing in painting from Arizona State University in 2002. Dane is an oil and watercolor painter who enjoyed the challenges of intensely realistic painting. Daneâ€™s subject matter ranges widely to include still-life and wildlife paintings, but he considers himself to be first and foremost an urban landscape painter. He has participated in group and solo exhibitions in Arlington, Virginia; Kuwait City, Kuwait; Pretoria, South Africa; and Nairobi, Kenya. Most recently Dane had a solo exhibition at the US Embassy in Rome, Italy in 2020.
